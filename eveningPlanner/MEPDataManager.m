In the beginning of 2001 the athletic field was put into operation, while the construction of scheduled 9 playing fields was actively progressing. In 2005 the construction activities were completed and for the first time in Armenia there was provided the occasion to play an aristocratic type of sports, GOLF by name,loved by millions of people all over the world. In parallel to the construction of golf fields, there were constructed also 18 “Mini Golf” fields, two tennis courts, a swimming pool, football and basketball fields, etc. In 2005 “Ararat Golf” club was renamed “Ararat Valley Country Club”, with the scope to gather people around the sport of golf. Within the framework of golf development in Armenia in 2007 the first golf competition was organized in Armenia. In the future the Golf Competition gave start of an annual Golf Tournament named by the founder of Ararat Golf Club and the President of Golf Association Mr. Vahak Hovnanian – “Vahakni Open” Golf Tournament."

Armenia has very rich culinary culture, with many influences of nations surrounding it. In its turn, Armenian culinary has had a great impact on the culinary culture of the neighboring countries. Yogurt is a good example of this. . First time I heard about yogurt in the US, when Colombo yogurt was advertised on the radio in the early 70s. On the other hand, Eastern Armenian cuisine that developed on the current mountainous territory of the Republic of Armenia has overseen many hardships.

The small 25 seat restaurant only had room for 9 letters on the sign… the building looked like a hut… so 'Pizza Hut' was born!A year later, in 1959, Pizza Hut was incorporated in Kansas, and Dick Hassur opened the first franchise unit in Topeka, Kansas. Fifteen years later, we opened the first UK restaurant and since then we've become the biggest Pizza Company on the planet!A subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc., the company oversees more than 11,000 pizza restaurants and delivery outlets in 90 countries worldwide."
